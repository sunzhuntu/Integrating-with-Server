# Integrating with Server

This project aims to integrate the frontend react application with the backend server implemented with Express.

## Directory Structure

Under the root directory of your react application, create a folder 'server', and put the 'server.js' under the server folder. By doing this, we integrate the backend server with the frontend application.

## How to Run

#### Frontend: npm start
#### Backend: npm run dev (add a script "dev": "nodemon server/server.js" in the package.json file)
